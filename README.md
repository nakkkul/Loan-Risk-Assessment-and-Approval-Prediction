# 🏦 Loan Risk Assessment and Approval Prediction

### 📜 Overview  
This project aims to **analyze and predict loan approval outcomes** based on applicant profiles and financial details. It involves **exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling** to determine both the **approval probability** and an associated **risk score** for applicants.
