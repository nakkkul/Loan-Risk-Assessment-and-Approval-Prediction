# Loan-Risk-Assessment-and-Approval-Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting loan approval outcomes based on applicant profiles and financial data. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling to assess both approval probability and risk score.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 20,000 samples with 36 features, including:
- **Applicant Details**: Age, Employment Status, Education Level, Experience, Marital Status, etc.
- **Financial Metrics**: Annual Income, Credit Score, Debt-to-Income Ratio, Monthly Loan Payment, etc.
- **Loan Details**: Loan Amount, Duration, Interest Rate, Loan Purpose, and Approval Status.

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration**: Analysis of key features, distributions, and correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating additional features and preparing data for model training.
- **Modeling**: Building machine learning models to predict `LoanApproved` and `RiskScore`.
